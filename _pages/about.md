Welcome to my website! I will be joining the WeBank Institute of FinTech at Shenzhen University this summer as an Assistant Professor in Economics.

My research interests are in macroeconomics, firm dynamics, and expectations. 

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from HKSUT in 2025, my master's degree in Finance and Economics from LSE in 2019, and my bachelor's degree in Finance from Shandong University in 2018.
